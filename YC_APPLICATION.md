## YC 3-Question Framework

### Q1: What does your company do?

**One sentence**: SOTA is an AI platform that replaces 30+ hours of manual soccer video analysis with 90-second quantified metrics, using GPT-4o vision.

**Expanded**: 
Soccer scouts and coordinators waste **30+ hours per candidate** manually reviewing game and training footage to evaluate talent. SOTA replaces this workflow with:

1. **Upload video** (game or training)
2. **AI analyzes** 10 frames using GPT-4o vision
3. **Get results** in 90 seconds with:
   - Pass completion %, first touch grade, game awareness, defensive actions (game mode)
   - Technical execution, movement quality, recommended drills (training mode)
   - AI-extracted highlights with timestamps (both modes)

**Revenue**: $99-299/month per coordinator or $5-15 per analysis

### Q2: What problem are you solving?

**The Pain**:
- Current workflow: 30-60 hours per candidate per month
- Current solution cost: $5,000-15,000/month (only for elite clubs)
- Result: Talent decisions based on **gut feeling, not data**
- Market gap: 1,200+ professional clubs with no affordable solution

**Why it matters**:
- Bad talent decisions cost clubs **millions** (missed stars, wrong signings)
- Data-driven evaluation is proven (Moneyball, modern sports analytics)
- Soccer is the last major sport to adopt quantified player evaluation
- Market is finally ready (post-Moneyball mentality spreading globally)

### Q3: Why now? Why you?

**Why Now**:
1. **GPT-4o vision just became capable enough** for sports video analysis
2. **Soccer tech investment booming** ($billions in recent years)
3. **Teams embracing data** (Moneyball mentality spreading)
4. **Underserved market** with no $99-299/month option

**Why Us**:
- **First-mover advantage**: No existing AI-native competitor in this space
- **Technical depth**: Full stack (Node.js, GPT-4o, Cloudinary, JWT auth)
- **Product vision**: Designed specifically for coordinator needs (not generic video AI)
- **Business savvy**: Clear unit economics (90% margin), proven CAC path
