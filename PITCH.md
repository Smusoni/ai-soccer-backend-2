## 3-Minute YC Narrative

### The Problem

**Coordinators are drowning in footage.**

At professional, academy, and semi-pro clubs:
- Evaluating a single candidate requires **30-60 hours** of manual video review
- Talent decisions are made on **gut feeling, not data**
- Existing AI tools cost **$5K-15K/month** (only for elite clubs)
- Missing **quantified metrics**: pass completion %, first touch grades, decision-making scores

This happens **1,200+ times per year** at each of the 1,200+ professional clubs globally. **$500M+ market** making decisions blind.

### Our Solution

**SOTA** = AI-Powered Talent Evaluation in 90 Seconds

**What we built:**
1. **Upload game OR training video**
2. **AI analyzes 10 frames across the duration**
3. **Get structured metrics + AI-extracted highlights**

**Game Analysis Output:**
- Pass completion %, first touch grade (1-10)
- Game awareness (positioning, scanning, decision quality)
- Defensive actions (tackles, interceptions, success rate)
- Critical moments with timestamps + assessments
- Alternative decisions (what else could they have done)
- Overall grade (1-10)

**Training Analysis Output:**
- Session focus detection
- Technical execution grade
- Movement quality + athleticism scores
- Decision-making under pressure
- Consistency assessment
- Recommended drills by weakness
- Highlights with timestamps

**Cost per analysis**: $0.10
**Sell for**: $5-15 per analysis OR $99-299/month

### Market Opportunity

- **TAM**: $500M (global soccer talent development)
- **SAM**: $50M (coordinator/scout subscriptions)
- **1,200+ professional clubs** × $299/month average = $358M annual SAM
- **Secondary markets**: Academies (50K+), semi-pro clubs (100K+), youth leagues

### Why Now

1. **GPT-4o vision just became good enough** for sports video analysis
2. **Soccer tech is hot**: $billions invested (Sorare, OneFootball, JMGO)
3. **Teams are finally embracing data**: Post-Moneyball mentality spreading globally
4. **Underserved market**: Expensive enterprise tools OR nothing. No $99-299/month option exists.
