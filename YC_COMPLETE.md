## The Philosophy Behind SOTA

Soccer is the world's most popular sport. Yet talent evaluation—a $500M annual market—is completely subjective. No data. No benchmarks. Just gut feeling.

We're fixing that with AI.

In 5 years, SOTA is the standard. Every club evaluates talent with data. The game becomes more meritocratic. Better players get opportunities. That's the vision.

But first, we need to raise $500K, land 50 customers, and prove this is a $1B+ company.

That's the next 18 months.

**You're ready. Go build something great.**
