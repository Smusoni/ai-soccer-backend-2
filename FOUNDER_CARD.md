# Ball Knowledge Founder Quick Reference

**Keep this card handy during YC interviews, demos, and investor meetings.**

## The Pitch (30 Seconds)

> Ball Knowledge uses AI to replace 30+ hours of manual soccer talent evaluation with 90-second quantified metrics. Upload a game or training video, get instant analysis on passing, first touch, game awareness, and defensive play. We're building Moneyball-for-soccer for the 1,200+ professional clubs globally who spend $500M annually on talent decisions.

---

## The Problem (60 Seconds)

**Before Ball Knowledge:**
- Scouts spend 30-60 hours per candidate reviewing footage manually
- Talent decisions are made on gut feeling, not data
- Existing solutions cost $5K-15K/month (only elite clubs)
- No affordable option exists for semi-pro clubs and academies

**Business impact:**
- Bad talent evaluations cost clubs millions (missed stars, wrong signings)
- 1,200+ professional clubs with 0 to $15K/month solutions (massive gap)
- Soccer is the last major sport avoiding data-driven talent evaluation

---

## The Solution (60 Seconds)

**What:**
1. Upload game or training video
2. AI analyzes 10 frames using GPT-4o vision
3. Get results in 90 seconds

**Game mode output:**
- Pass completion % (quantified)
- First touch quality (1-10 grade)
- Game awareness (positioning, decision quality)
- Defensive actions (tackles, interceptions)
- Critical moments (auto-identified with timestamps)
- Overall performance grade (1-10)

**Training mode output:**
- Technical execution (1-10 grade)
- Movement quality (speed, fluidity, athleticism)

- Recommended drills for improvement
- Areas to focus on

**Why it's better:**
- 10x cheaper ($99-299/month vs. $5K+/month)
- 90 seconds vs. 30+ hours of work
- AI-generated, so totally objective
- Coach-specific recommendations, not generic data

## Competitive Response (When Asked)

**"Isn't Wyscout/Hudl already doing this?"**

> Wyscout and Hudl are expensive manual tools designed for coaches, not scouts. They don't use AI for analysis, they require manual tagging, and they cost $5-15K/month. Ball Knowledge is AI-first, coordinator-focused, and 10x cheaper. We're different category.

**"Why will coordinators switch from Wyscout?"**

> 90% of the market can't afford Wyscout. We're targeting the 50K+ semi-pro clubs and 500K+ academies that have zero solution today. We're not stealing from Wyscout, we're expanding the market.

**"What if OpenAI changes their pricing?"**

> Our cost per analysis is $0.10. Even if it doubles to $0.20, we still have 95%+ margins. Plus, we can fine-tune our own model as volumes grow. Low unit costs give us defensibility.

**"How will you defend against bigger players building this?"**

> (1) First-mover advantage with proprietary data on 10K+ player analyses, (2) Network effects as we build benchmark database, (3) Partnership moat (white-label integrations), (4) Domain expertise (soccer-specific metrics, not generic video AI). By the time they build it, we'll own the market.

## Demo Script (2 Minutes)

**Setup (30 seconds):**
> "I'm going to show you Ball Knowledge's core flow. We have a coordinator signed up here. She already has a candidate profile set up—Alex Johnson, midfielder at an academy."

**Demo (90 seconds):**
1. "I'm uploading a 2-minute training video"
2. "Watch this—in 90 seconds, we'll have full AI analysis"
3. [System analyzes]
4. "Here's the output: Technical execution grade of 8/10, movement quality 7.5/10, consistency 8/10"
5. "And here are the 3 auto-extracted highlights with timestamps—these are the best moments from the training session"
6. "That's the full product. From upload to results in 90 seconds."

**Close (30 seconds):**
> "What takes a scout 30 hours to do manually, Ball Knowledge does in 90 seconds with perfect objectivity. At $299/month, we're 20x cheaper than Wyscout. And 1,200+ professional clubs all need this. That's our market."

## Questions to Ask the YC Partner Back

(Shows you're thinking strategically)

1. "Have you seen other AI-first sports analysis companies? What happened to them?"
2. "Do you think the international markets (Europe, Latin America) are realistic for expansion?"
3. "What would success look like for Ball Knowledge in Year 1 from your perspective?"
4. "Are there other portfolio companies we could partner with?"
5. "What's your experience with sports tech investments?"

---

## Red Flags to Address Proactively

**Before they bring it up, say:**

1. **"Aren't AI sports analysis tools commoditizing?"**
   > Different category. Generic video AI doesn't work for sports. We're soccer-specific, coordinator-focused, with proprietary metrics. Plus, we're 18+ months ahead of competition.

2. **"How many paying customers do you have right now?"**
   > MVP is deployed and tested. We have 10 pilot clubs ready to launch next month. We're pre-revenue but post-product-market-fit signals.

3. **"How is this different from [other startup]?"**
   > [Other startup] is [tool], not [talent evaluation]. Different problem, different customer, different market.

4. **"What if a bigger player copies you?"**
   > See competitive response above. By then we'll own the data, partnerships, and market.
